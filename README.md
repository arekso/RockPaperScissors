# RockPaperScissors

This project is to play rock paper scissors with the computer by using the 
if statements,
prompt and alert, and
Two functions.

The oneRound() function was called on 5x that has a helper method being called on as well. Finally, completing the fifth round will alert the player the final score thus ending the game.
